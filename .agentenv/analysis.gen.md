## Project Architecture Analysis

This section contains insights and recommendations generated from an automated analysis of the project.

### Project Mission

go42 serves as an opinionated blueprint for developing cloud-native services in Go. The project's core purpose is to establish a comprehensive and scalable Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) framework that addresses the entire lifecycle of a service, from initial development to deployment and operation. It aims to solve the problem of repeated boilerplate and inconsistent architectural patterns when building new services by providing a well-defined structure, enforced conventions, and pre-configured best practices. The target audience is developers and teams building backend services who value consistency, automation, and security. The primary business value is in accelerating development, reducing operational overhead, and ensuring a high-quality, secure foundation for any new Go-based service.

### Architectural Philosophy

The architecture is based on a modular, service-oriented design philosophy. While it can be deployed as a single unit (a modular monolith), its structure is intentionally decoupled to support a future transition to microservices. The design is heavily influenced by Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles, emphasizing a strict separation of concerns. The core architectural strategy is to isolate business logic from external concerns like databases, caches, and APIs. This is achieved by organizing code into distinct layers and domains, with dependencies pointing inwards towards the core logic. This approach prioritizes testability, maintainability, and the ability to swap infrastructure components without impacting the core application. The use of an `outbox` pattern, for instance, indicates a design that values data consistency across service boundaries in an event-driven environment.

### Domain Model

The project itself does not model a specific business domain but rather provides a framework of technical domains required to build a robust service. The core concepts are foundational components of a modern application. These include:
- **Authentication (`auth`):** Manages identity and access control, acting as a distinct bounded context for all security-related concerns.
- **Configuration (`config`):** Centralizes application configuration, abstracting the source of settings from the application logic.
- **Data Persistence (`database`):** Provides an abstraction layer for database operations, decoupling the application from a specific database technology.
- **Eventing (`events`):** Defines a system for asynchronous communication between different parts of the application or with external systems.
- **Observability (`metrics`):** Encapsulates the logic for instrumenting the application with metrics, logs, and traces.

These domains are designed to be composed together to form a complete service, with business-specific logic intended to be built on top of this foundational structure.

### Design Principles

The project is governed by a set of strict design principles aimed at maximizing clarity, consistency, and long-term maintainability.
- **Convention over Configuration:** The project relies on a comprehensive set of documented conventions (`CONVENTIONS.md`) that cover everything from commit messages to import order. This reduces ambiguity and cognitive load for developers.
- **API-First Development:** Service contracts are defined first using technology-agnostic specifications like OpenAPI and Protobuf. This ensures that the API is well-designed and serves as a stable contract for clients and other services, with implementation following the contract.
- **Dependency Injection:** Components are designed to be loosely coupled, with dependencies explicitly provided (injected) rather than being created internally. This is evident in conventions like passing loggers as options, which enhances testability and modularity.
- **Explicitness and Type Safety:** The conventions strongly discourage the use of ambiguous or dynamic structures like anonymous interfaces or structs. This principle prioritizes compile-time safety and code readability over concise but potentially unsafe shortcuts.
- **Strict Separation of Concerns:** A key principle is the enforcement of dependency rules, such as utility code in `internal/tools` being forbidden from importing other internal application code. This maintains a clean separation between generic, reusable code and application-specific logic.

### Technical Decisions

The technology stack was chosen to support the project's goals of creating high-performance, scalable, and maintainable cloud-native services.
- **Go Language:** Selected for its strong performance, built-in concurrency primitives, and suitability for building networked services. Its static typing and robust standard library align with the project's emphasis on reliability.
- **Dual API Protocols (gRPC & OpenAPI):** The decision to support both gRPC and HTTP/JSON via OpenAPI was a deliberate trade-off. gRPC is used for efficient, low-latency internal service-to-service communication, while OpenAPI provides a widely compatible and human-readable interface for external or web-based clients.
- **Database Agnosticism:** The architecture is intentionally designed to support multiple SQL databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite). This was a strategic choice to avoid vendor lock-in and provide flexibility for different deployment environments and requirements.
- **Intensive CI/CD Automation:** The extensive use of GitHub Actions for linting, testing, security scanning, and builds is a core technical decision. The philosophy is to automate quality and security gates to the greatest extent possible, catching issues early and enforcing conventions automatically.
- **Container-Native Deployment:** The inclusion of `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` signifies that the intended deployment model is through containers. This decision aligns with modern cloud-native practices, ensuring portability and consistency across different environments.

### Quality Philosophy

The project's approach to quality is comprehensive and proactive, embedding quality checks throughout the development lifecycle.
- **Multi-Layered Testing:** The testing strategy is not limited to a single type of test. It includes unit tests co-located with the code, dedicated integration tests (`tests/integration`) to verify interactions between components, and load tests (`tests/load`) to ensure performance and reliability under stress.
- **Static Analysis as a First Line of Defense:** Quality assurance begins before the code is even run. A vast array of linters for Go code, documentation, Dockerfiles, and more are integrated directly into the CI pipeline. This philosophy aims to catch potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, and stylistic inconsistencies at the earliest possible stage.
- **Security by Design:** Security is treated as a foundational, non-negotiable aspect of quality. This is demonstrated by the integration of tools like `gitleaks` for secret scanning and dedicated security workflows in the CI pipeline, rather than treating security as a final, pre-deployment check.
- **Reliability and Idempotency:** The convention that database migrations must be idempotent reflects a philosophy of building reliable and resilient systems. This ensures that deployments are repeatable and can recover from partial failures without corrupting the system's state.

### Evolution Strategy

The project is designed with long-term evolution and maintainability in mind.
- **API Versioning:** The API structure includes version numbers (e.g., `v1`). This is a deliberate strategy to allow the API to evolve over time by introducing new versions while maintaining backward compatibility for existing clients.
- **Modular Architecture:** The clear separation of domains and layers serves as the primary evolution strategy. It allows individual components (like the caching mechanism or authentication logic) to be refactored, replaced, or upgraded with minimal impact on the rest of the system.
- **Documenting Architectural Decisions:** The inclusion of a directory for Architecture Decision Records (`docs/adr`) indicates a commitment to documenting the rationale behind significant architectural choices. This practice is crucial for future developers to understand the system's history and make informed decisions as it evolves.
- **Designed for Extension:** The project is fundamentally a template or blueprint. Its evolution is intended to happen by being forked or used as a starting point for new services. The clear boundaries and interfaces are designed to be extended with custom business logic.

### Folder Structure Philosophy

The folder structure is organized to enforce the architectural principles of separation of concerns and modularity. Each top-level directory has a distinct and clear purpose.

- **`api/`**: Defines the service's public contracts.
  - *Rationale*: By centralizing API definitions (OpenAPI, Protobuf), this folder separates the "what" (the API contract) from the "how" (the implementation). This supports an API-first workflow and allows for generating client/server code.
  ```
  api/
  ├── proto/      # gRPC service definitions
  └── openapi/    # OpenAPI specifications
  ```

- **`cmd/`**: Contains the entry points for executable applications.
  - *Rationale*: This structure allows a single repository to produce multiple binaries (e.g., the main server, a worker, a CLI tool). It keeps the `main` package minimal, with all logic delegated to other packages.
  ```
  cmd/
  └── app/
      └── main.go # Main application entry point
  ```

- **`internal/`**: Holds all the private application code.
  - *Rationale*: This is a Go convention. Code inside `internal/` cannot be imported by other projects, enforcing encapsulation and preventing unintended external dependencies on the project's core logic. The sub-folder structure follows the principles of Clean Architecture, separating domains and infrastructure concerns.
  ```
  internal/
  ├── auth/       # Core logic for the auth domain
  ├── database/   # Database abstraction and repositories
  ├── api/        # API handlers (HTTP, gRPC)
  └── config/     # Configuration loading and management
  ```

- **`pkg/`**: Contains public library code, safe for external use.
  - *Rationale*: While `internal/` is for private code, `pkg/` is for code that is intentionally shared and can be imported by other projects. This clearly delineates the project's public API from its implementation details.

- **`etc/`**: Stores configuration files for various development tools.
  - *Rationale*: Centralizing tool configuration (linters, commit hooks, etc.) in one place keeps the root directory clean and makes it easy to manage the development environment's setup.
  ```
  etc/
  ├── .golangci.yml       # Linter configuration
  ├── .commitlintrc.yaml  # Commit message conventions
  └── gitleaks.toml       # Secret scanning rules
  ```

- **`infra/`**: Contains Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
  - *Rationale*: This folder separates infrastructure definitions (Terraform, Helm) from the application code, allowing infrastructure to be managed and versioned alongside the application it supports.
  ```
  infra/
  ├── terraform/  # Terraform configurations
  └── helm/       # Helm charts for Kubernetes deployment
  ```

- **`migrate/`**: Holds database migration files.
  - *Rationale*: Separating migrations from the application logic makes database schema management explicit and tool-agnostic. It allows schema changes to be versioned and applied independently of the application's deployment.

- **`tests/`**: Contains end-to-end, integration, and load tests.
  - *Rationale*: While unit tests are co-located with their respective packages, this top-level directory is for tests that span multiple components or require a running instance of the application, thus separating different testing scopes.
