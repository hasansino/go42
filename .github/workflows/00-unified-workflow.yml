name: unified-workflow

# Unified workflow - linting, testing, and security scanning.
# This workflow is designed for development and testing stages.
#
# Actions are executed by `runners` that are provided by GitHub.
# They are not free and billed per minute, although 2000 minutes per month are included in the free tier.
# @note MacOS runners are 10x more expensive than Linux runners.
#
# Running this workflow too often can ramp-up actions costs significantly.
# One way to mitigate this, is to use a self-hosted runners.
# @see https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners
#
# @todo `with` arguments are repeated because `with` does not support context
# @see https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/25246
