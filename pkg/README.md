# `/pkg`

Packages safe to import and use by external applications. Putting code in `/pkg` directory explicitly communicates that this code is intended to be re-used elsewhere, so make sure it is well documented. The [`I'll take pkg over internal`](https://travisjeffery.com/b/2019/11/i-ll-take-pkg-over-internal/) blog post by Travis Jeffery provides a good overview of the `pkg` and `internal` directories and when it might make sense to use them.

It's also a way to group Go code in one place when your root directory contains lots of non-Go components and directories making it easier to run various Go tools (as mentioned in these talks: [`Best Practices for Industrial Programming`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTE4VJIdHPg) from GopherCon EU 2018, [GopherCon 2018: Kat Zien - How Do You Structure Your Go Apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL6JBUk6tj0) and [GoLab 2018 - Massimiliano Pippi - Project layout patterns in Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gQa1LWwuzk)).

Note that this is not a universally accepted pattern and for every popular repo that uses it you can find 10 that don't. It's up to you to decide if you want to use this pattern or not. Regardless of whether it is or not a good pattern more people will know what you mean than not.

## Origins

The old golang source code used to use `pkg` for its packages and then various Go projects in the community started copying the pattern (see [`this`](https://twitter.com/bradfitz/status/1039512487538970624) Brad Fitzpatrick's tweet for more context).
